Hi! I'm currently a year 2 student in Singapoer Polytechnic as of 2020. I have chosen to take up this module as I love to build and create things that benefit people around me. It gives me a sense of accomplisment to be able to help someone in need by creating something first in my mind then bring it into reality.

Its an honor to be able to be given this opportunity to be able to build something for *real* at a polytechnic level.
