				<h3>My Initial Ideas</h3>
				<img src="Images/sketch1.jpeg" style="width: 400px;height: 800px">
				<h4>Medical and emergency supply kit</h4>
				<h4>Discription</h4>
				<p>The context is that a friend of mine told me of how it was difficult for her to access her medical supplies like her inhailer or her pills if needed when she gets an asthmah attack while in her canoe. It is also hard for her to signal to others around her that she is in need as most of the time her friends wont be close enough to hear or notice her in trouble. This prototype is design to help her to easily be able to access her inhailer when she gets an attack without the need to search through her medical bag like she usually does. It also has a compartment for the pills if the inhailer sizes to work. Besides that, the device also has a led lamp attached to it that will alert people around her that she is in need should the need arise.</p>
				<p>Sadly in the end this could not be accomplised as the water proofing would be a great chellange for my first project and my lecturer discoraged me to try water proof projects on my first attempt. The second reason was because the electricals does not require a computer with the simple functions of the prototype</p>
				<h4>Automatic Planter</h4>
				<h4>Discription</h4>
				<p>The context of this idea is that, my mom loves to have plants at home and she seems to not be able to cope with the plants that she has. This prototype will help to automatically water and sun one plant taking off the load from her.</p>
				<p>The idea is scraped as the light source needed may not be obtainable(The use of the light source is to provide light at night so that the plant will continue to photosynthsise at night.)</p>
				<h3>My chosen Idea</h3>
				<img src="Images/sketch2.jpeg" style="width: 400px;height: 800px">
				<h4>Laptop Tempreture Regulating Cooling Fans</h4>
				<h4>Discription</h4>
				<p>It is a simple Lap top cooling fan that is able to detect and measure the tempreture of that laptop. The function is to simply cool the base of the laptop when ever it gets over the desired tempreture.</p>
				<p>The main reason why this idea is chosen is because it is simple to implement and a good start for my first project in polytechnic</p>
				<h4>Prototype 1</h4>
				<img src="Images/prot111.jpeg" style="width: 490px;height: 400px">
				<img src="Images/prot11.jpeg" style="width: 490px;height: 400px">
				<img src="Images/prot1.jpeg" style="width: 490px;height: 400px">
				<p>the first prototype was just to get a feel of how the product will be like in the real world and if it will be effective as a stand on its own without the cooling functions</p>
				<p>I was very happy with how it turned out. Even in cardboard form it was able to support my laptop and continue to do so as i use my laptop ontop of it. The few issues is that the angle was too high and caused my and to ace while useing the laptop on the stand.</p>
                <h4>Prototype 2</h4>
                <img src="Images/prot2.jpeg" style="width: 490px;height: 400px">
                <p>The second prototype was to try and fit in the electronics and see if they fit the design.</p>
                <img src="Images/prot22.jpeg" style="width: 490px;height: 400px">
                <p>(1) is the hole ment for the LCD screen. the use is to display the tempreture and speed of the fans<br></p>
                <p>(2) is for a varable resistor. this is for changing the speeds of the fans manualy.<br></p>
                <p>In conclusion, the LCD screen will get covered by the laptop after testing and there is no practical way for implimenting a screen because of the complications in programming and circuitry</p>
                <img src="Images/prot222.jpeg" style="width: 490px;height: 400px">
                <p>for the storage of the electronics i have desided to use a long plate underneath the top plate.</p>
                <h4>Final design</h4>
                <img src="Images/final2.jpeg" style="width: 490px;height: 400px">
                <img src="Images/final.jpeg" style="width: 490px;height: 400px">
                <p>In the final design i have removed the LCD screen and instead of that I desided to use a LDR for simplicity. The angle of the top plate is lowered so that it is not so painful for use.</p>
                <img src="Images/container.jpeg" style="width: 490px;height: 400px">
                <img src="Images/container2.jpeg" style="width: 490px;height: 400px">
                <p>The containment for the electronics i have desided to 3D print a small box behind the front support pice</p>
